## Overview

Welcome to the Dead by Daylight Post Game Tracker! If you're like me and obsessed with the asymmetrical horror game Dead by Daylight, you've come to the right place. This tool is designed to help you track and analyze the performance of players in your matches. The code I will be pulling from comes from user iislam99 at https://github.com/iislam99/Dead-by-Daylight-Score-Tracker.git.

## Game Basics

In Dead by Daylight, each match consists of 4 survivors and 1 killer. The survivors must work together to escape the match before the killer finds and sacrifices them to the entity. What makes the game interesting is that each survivor is fundementally the same, except for exclusive perks that provide them with unique abilities.

For instance, Dwight Fairfield, the face of the survivors, possesses a perk that speeds up generator completion when working with others. As you level him up, you can unlock and utilize this perk across different survivors. The variety of character builds and perks is what fascinates me, and I aim to help players track and evaluate their effectiveness.

## Features

- **Perk Tracking:** Record and review the perks chosen by each player at the end of the match.
- **Point Analysis:** Evaluate the amount of points earned by each player, providing insights into their contributions.
- **Outcome Summary:** Determine whether each player successfully escaped or fell victim to the killer.

## Purpose

This software is designed to benefit both newcomers and seasoned players by offering a comprehensive understanding of each teammate's performance. By analyzing the chosen perks, points earned, and match outcomes, users can make informed decisions about the effectiveness of different character builds.

## How to Use

Simply input the relevant data at the end of each match, and let the tracker do the rest. Whether you're a survivor strategizing your next build or a killer assessing survivor trends, this tool is your key to improving your Dead by Daylight experience.

Happy tracking, and may you escape the Entity's realm unscathed!
